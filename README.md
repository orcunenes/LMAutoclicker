"# LMAutoclicker" 

This Autoclicker was made for personal use.
I've been wasting my time while claiming more than 6,000 quests on Lords Mobile, so I made an auto-clicker that claims quests for me.

You can use this on an emulator and do your quests while you are away.

To use it, double-click the.bat file and press K.

I will make a setup for this after I finish my other projects.
